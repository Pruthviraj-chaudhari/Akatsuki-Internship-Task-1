1. **Components**:
   - **Functional Components**: Create components for different parts of the website like the header, footer, and blog cards.

2. **Props**:
   - Pass data to components using props to make components reusable and dynamic.

3. **Mapping Data**:
   - Use JavaScript's `map()` method to iterate over blog data and render multiple blog cards.

4. **CSS Modules or Styled Components** (Optional):
   - Apply styles to your components using CSS Modules or Styled Components for scoped styling.
